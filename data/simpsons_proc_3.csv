Homer Simpson,yeah probably anyway once upon a time there was a big mean lion who got a thorn in his paw and all the village people tried to pull it out but nobody was strong enough so they got hercules and hercules used his mighty strength and bingo anyway the moral is the lion was so happy he gave hercules this big thing of riches

Homer Simpson,stupid movies who invented these dumb things anyway was it you bart
Homer Simpson,no one man can do all that youre a liar honey a dirty rotten liar
Homer Simpson,really a restaurant well now i dont know what to think
Homer Simpson,reading about this edison character they wont let me in the big people library downtown there was some unpleasantness i can never go back
Homer Simpson,ooh look at all the inventions edison came up with the stock ticker the storage battery even wax paper and look at him dance
Homer Simpson,and these hardy boys books are great too this one is about smugglers
Homer Simpson,no not this one the smugglers of pirate cove its about pirates
Marge Simpson,that doesnt sound like me well i suppose if this doesnt work out you can always go back to the plant
Homer Simpson,yeah yeah yeah yeah great story lenny but heres one thats even more spellbinding once upon a time there was a man named thomas edison and he invented the dictating machine and the fluoroscope and the repeating telegraph
Homer Simpson,and he was a firm believer in fletcherism and he played the organ and his favorite flower was the heliotrope -- oh and his middle name was alva and he never ever ever wore pajamas and
Homer Simpson,well i remember where edison worked it was menlo park thats where he came up with the tasimeter the ore separator and
Homer Simpson,and then he worked on a machine to communicate with the dead some kind of scary telephone i guess or maybe he planned to just stick his head under the ground and yell
Marge Simpson,all right already everyone knows the man accomplished a lot maybe because he didnt spend every waking moment talking about thomas edison
Homer Simpson,ohh thats where youre wrong marge he was a shameless self-promoter
Homer Simpson,marge thats it thats why i havent done anything with my life i need to be more like thomas edison
Homer Simpson,well i quit my job just like you said to
Homer Simpson,yes you did i remember your exact words you said i should quit my job and become an inventor or youd torch the house
Homer Simpson,at my age edison had already invented 203 things ohh ive got a lot of work to do to catch up to him
Homer Simpson,what eh eh let me handle the creative end of this marge you dont understand how the creative mind works like i do
Homer Simpson,you look at this table and what do you see just a table now a creative person like me looks at this table and sees all kinds of creative things -- but no tables
Homer Simpson,uh this isnt working ive got to try a different approach
Homer Simpson,as long as youre here annoying me lets have a brainstorming session now heres how it works lisa you say one thing then bart you say another just toss out things and ill use my inventive mind to combine them into a brilliant original idea
Homer Simpson,a-- wait a minute these arent exciting new products youre not even trying okay thats it both of you go to your rooms and spank yourselves
Marge Simpson,homer you cant punish the children just because you cant come up with an idea
Homer Simpson,i dont see why not theyre my kids i own em
Marge Simpson,hm i brought you a tuna sandwich they say its brain food i guess because theres so much dolphin in it and you know how smart they are
Homer Simpson,ohhh its no use i cant work like this cut off from the scientific community
Homer Simpson,look i just want to know how to invent things tell me
Homer Simpson,okay i have here the four greatest inventions in the history of mankind
Homer Simpson,first my all-purpose electric hammer for all your pounding needs
Homer Simpson,this will sound every three seconds unless something isnt okay
Homer Simpson,but it does break easily now this next ones for the ladies how many times have you gals been late for a high-powered business meeting only to realize youre not wearing makeup
Homer Simpson,thats why i invented this revolutionary makeup gun its for the woman who only has four-fifths of a second to get ready close your eyes marge
Homer Simpson,and now youre ready for a night on the town
Homer Simpson,eh oh okay this time try to keep your nostrils closed
Homer Simpson,oh look what you did now i have to get my cold cream gun
Homer Simpson,women will like what i tell them to like now heres something for everyone
Homer Simpson,in the olden times if you were watching tv and nature called youd have to get up and walk to the bathroom it was the hardest thing in the world to do but now with the lazy man reclining toilet chair you can just lean back and let er rip
Homer Simpson,sure believe me every man in america will want to have one
Marge Simpson,im not saying youre a bad inventor im just saying these particular inventions are awful and no one in their right mind would buy them or accept them as gifts
Homer Simpson,but this is the best i could do i guess im no better at being thomas edison than i was at being homer simpson
Marge Simpson,oh dear i hope i wasnt too rough on him
Homer Simpson,all week my life long dream was to be the next thomas edison but now its over i guess ill just give up my hopes and dreams and settle for being a decent husband and father
Homer Simpson,oh that i stuck a couple of extra legs on there cause i kept tipping over when i was trying to invent stuff
Homer Simpson,look mr edison i did it im an inventor and i owe it all to you
Homer Simpson,see its just a regular chair but i attached a couple of extra legs to the back kinda like the ones on the back of your
Bart Simpson,hey dad heard you swearing mind if i join in crap boobs crap
Homer Simpson,i thought i had a great idea but i mustve seen it on this poster
Bart Simpson,if edison thought of that chair how come its not on this chart
Homer Simpson,so weve got to go to the edison museum and smash it then ill be an inventor
Homer Simpson,oh son youre young and headstrong just like thomas edison jr you know he started a mushroom farm and an auto parts company and he sold his good name to a quack medicine company oh and later he raised turkeys that was on his turkey farm
Homer Simpson,outta the way this is one invention youre not getting credit for you inspiration hog

Marge Simpson,because i didnt want him finding out about the party i mean hes okay but you know hed bring sarah and i just dont care for that woman
Homer Simpson,and when you pushed me off the bridge its cause you knew about the party and wanted to make sure i got here

Bart Simpson,finish the damn story ive got a hockey game tonight
Homer Simpson,now granted i was just a kid but i say
Homer Simpson,grampa always hated bongo and loved money so he sold bongo to a wicked farm witch just so he could hang out with a bunch of rich dogs and kidnapped santa so id never get the toy i actually wanted--

Homer Simpson,wait wait theres one part of the story even grampa didnt know about a few months later i went to rescue bongo
Homer Simpson,bongo was happy without me he had become her dog
Homer Simpson,well thats just the way dogs are the most disloyal unfaithful creatures god ever made

Marge Simpson,youve been through a traumatic experience are you sure you wanna go to work today

Homer Simpson,oh my god this unsourced undated video has convinced me beyond any doubt
Homer Simpson,preppies oh i hate you guys always partying on deck with your docksiders while us townies are scrubbing the bilge
Homer Simpson,id slash my wrists but how without my electric knife
Homer Simpson,secrets i have no secrets just enjoy this golden time you will soon cling desperately to the memory of smell some bread
Homer Simpson,yeah but ill go home weigh myself and ill have gained six pounds whats that about
Homer Simpson,i guess an open garage isnt the best hiding place
Homer Simpson,i wish son the best way to explain this is to show you some age-inappropriate movies
Homer Simpson,so what have you learned so far from our post-apocalyptic movie marathon
Bart Simpson,guys who call themselves preacher or deacon are very bad water is money unless gasoline is money and even though lots of things are razor-sharp no one ever shaves
Homer Simpson,hollywood has taught you well my son now lets push play
Homer Simpson,wow your end of the world is better than my during the world
Homer Simpson,aw uh listen ive gotta know youre not just being nice to me because in a pinch you could make candles from my fat
Marge Simpson,i cant find all our cereal crackers juice boxes the butter brush

Homer Simpson,its very late in the marriage to tell me that
Homer Simpson,see these are our bug-out bags in here is everything we need to survive
Marge Simpson,its reassuring to see youre aware of the future but this is all a little creepy
Homer Simpson,creepy marge the apocalypse is coming maybe not tomorrow maybe never but its coming and soon

Homer Simpson,marge when i started prepping for the end of the world everyone laughed at me
Homer Simpson,well just because i imagined it doesnt make it any less true and now all those people are on their own
Marge Simpson,homer simpson when i fell in love with you it was because of your big heart and your good looks but some day those good looks are gonna fade
Marge Simpson,im proud of you society may have crumbled but our decency hasnt
Homer Simpson,no i want to help the people who didnt prepare
Homer Simpson,now were going to leave this place im sorry bart -- i know youve made a bug-out camp girlfriend
Bart Simpson,ive got to be honest with you it was just a bag of rice i drew a face on
Homer Simpson,so well take these supplies back to springfield where theyre needed most
Homer Simpson,okay everybody keep your eyes peeled for an unlit mile post marked twenty-three of thirty-six or something if we miss it were dead
Homer Simpson,how can that be i took every last can of gas
Homer Simpson,now everyone relax and pretend were about to be hit by a soft brick wall
Homer Simpson,out of our way corn the starving people of springfield are desperately in need of our delivery of canned corn corn flakes and flash frozen corn nibblets
Homer Simpson,now to save these sorry souls from a life of anarchy starvation and having sex for procreation
Bart Simpson,dad you said people would be drinking each others blood
Homer Simpson,you got to watch a vhs copy of red dawn thirteen times stop complaining
Marge Simpson,are you really so disappointed the world didnt end just so you could be proven right
Homer Simpson,good riddance when i found out shrimp cocktails had no alcohol i really lost interest
Homer Simpson,goodbye my electrical friends i cant afford to use you so im doing what any good american would do -- throw you away
Homer Simpson,this could come in handy but let me check that list of things marge said never to bring home dogs cats octopuses octopi octopuseseses
Bart Simpson,hey dont blame me -- i didnt even take the test
Bart Simpson,driving you crazy instead of pulling off your legs ive really matured
Bart Simpson,when i think begging i dont imagine someone standing up

Marge Simpson,burly paper towels burlyville minnesota dear sir or madam your paper towel packets promised a hundred and two sheets of towels but i was blessed to receive one hundred and three im returning the extra towel unused
Marge Simpson,a pillowcase full of quarters where did you get that money and what have you done with the pillows
Homer Simpson,the pillows are safe at my workstation as for the quarters well im ashamed to tell you what i did
Marge Simpson,well were gonna turn this change into change for the better
Homer Simpson,and i wish that mr teeny gets a banana that the isotopes emerge from this season with a great blooper reel i wish that wishing wells worked so i wasnt just tossing my money away and that marge loves me forever no matter what stupid things i do
Marge Simpson,and i hope bart passes his test and saves the school
Bart Simpson,the least common blood type is a--b b--a c--ab d--o doh
Marge Simpson,im not sure if you gave my son any extra help but if you did thank you
Marge Simpson,would you like to have coffee or dinner or just talk
Marge Simpson,in this exciting strategy game you amass resources -- timber salt fish and wax -- to fund a syndicate to gain influence with the doges of venice
Bart Simpson,doges why do we have to play this stupid game lisa likes
Marge Simpson,we have to do something until the storm passes now just fill out these customs forms and we can get started
Bart Simpson,no whenever we play that my elbow touches dads junk

Homer Simpson,oh my god oh my god this counts as a walk
Homer Simpson,lenny take us with you to find our dog its okay marge theyre professionals
Marge Simpson,what cause they rented a van and taped an antenna to the top
Marge Simpson,all right but im coming with you to make sure no one does anything stupid
Homer Simpson,maybe look you guys obviously know about weather but i understand something much more predictable women
Homer Simpson,what women really want is a guy whos confident enough to go completely downhill after marriage and know shell still love him
Marge Simpson,homer you do not have to compete with your friends for me
Homer Simpson,fine but i swear i will win you back from lenny
Homer Simpson,help me god what is it im paying you for every sunday
Homer Simpson,he was a black guy but his voice sounded like a white guy
Marge Simpson,i dont know if were gonna be able to get out what are you writing
Marge Simpson,except for the face full of glass when the door finally collapsed he did a pretty good job
Homer Simpson,now i know you kids are scared by what happened but its bedtime just go into your dark rooms and shut your eyes
Marge Simpson,homie if we did both die weve never named guardians the kids could end up wards of the state
Homer Simpson,okay youre right its hard to imagine anyone else bringing up our kids but i think the choice is obvious -- my dad
Homer Simpson,oh yeah the tornado was more of a father to me than you okay how about my brother hes rich
Marge Simpson,theres really only one choice or should i say two identical choices
Homer Simpson,oh how very kind of you i am not giving our kids to these gravelly-voiced super hags one lump please
Homer Simpson,all right marge maybe were being a little too choosy about who our kids spend the rest of their lives with well take what we can get
Marge Simpson,uh oh i wonder if word has gotten out that were looking for guardians
Homer Simpson,kids theres nothing to worry aboutbut were looking at replacements for your mom and me if we should fail to die together as a family
Bart Simpson,oh i see you guys are trying to find a couple of saps to take us when dad has a coronary in the dead of night rolls over and crushes mom
Homer Simpson,this is not that and that smart-alecky attitude is exactly why no one wants you
Homer Simpson,okay ill nudge em with the car well get a whole meet cute thing going
Bart Simpson,how bout asking that japanese guy who set the world record for eating hot dogs hes like a successful version of dad
Marge Simpson,maybe we should just give up for now have some fried clams and collect sea glass
Homer Simpson,wowww your house is perfect no sharp corners no unsafe balconies a cool grampa
Homer Simpson,wow i assumed the jackson five were the only perfect family but now i see theres another
Homer Simpson,uh say listen portia how would you and mav feel about um swinging
Homer Simpson,okay take whatever time you need i just want to know if youd like to be their guardians
Bart Simpson,all you need to know is im a politeness monster who eats please and farts thank yous maam

Homer Simpson,worrywart marge you dont look a trojan horse in the mouth
Homer Simpson,i swear to you marge when i have the time i will google them both
Homer Simpson,oh uh well he wanted to be here but im gonna decrease the volume of my voice and mumble so you cant really understand what im saying
Marge Simpson,well i must admit its a relief to get that taken care of
Homer Simpson,too late you already signed oh wait theres one more
Homer Simpson,hey if they can watch em for the rest of their lives they can certainly do it for a weekend
Marge Simpson,i guess as long as we dont make it a habit
Marge Simpson,do you have to do that in front of people
Homer Simpson,marge this has been great couples time the one thing people with kids desperately need is no kids
Marge Simpson,well at least we have time to get the pets christmas presents
Homer Simpson,i dont like the way they just rip the paper off santas little helper my ass
Homer Simpson,no one steals my kids except me from that theme park jail that i never told you about except i guess i just did were all caught up now lets go
Homer Simpson,like all childless couples they troll the beaches waiting for the egg-layers to wander off from their young
Marge Simpson,shes gonna raise three kids without wrecking that perfect figure
Homer Simpson,dont worry marge well get em unless we die on this icy mountain road then theyve won forever
Marge Simpson,what if they are better for the kids than us
Homer Simpson,marge let me set your mind straight about something -- that spectacular young couple is definitely better for the kids but those kids are ours because we made them by accident and now were gonna take them back because we love them especially now that weve had a little time apart from them
Homer Simpson,ive got a bone to pick with you then an apology to make then we exchange insurance information then more bone picking
Homer Simpson,sure you wanted the fun parts but do you want to go to their little league games and recitals
Marge Simpson,look before anyone says anything else how could you possibly think you could get our kids
Bart Simpson,well im afraid that we dont want to be with anyone but mom and whoever she chooses to be with
Marge Simpson,kids your father and i have decided were not in such a hurry to get you guardians
Homer Simpson,instead of concentrating on dying were going to concentrate on living
Homer Simpson,i do call this living living the way kids in india can only dream of
Marge Simpson,turn right onto first street head east homer watch the road not this road the other road
Homer Simpson,ladies please you can boss me around just one at a time
Marge Simpson,on main street turn right now our sunday drive is ruined hands at ten and two
Bart Simpson,get out of my face cootie breath i did miss you you stink come over saturday im gonna have to push you in the mud now

Bart Simpson,hey relax she knows shes the apple of the corner of my eye
Bart Simpson,a lot of musical talent in this house but no one blows on a blade of grass like you
Bart Simpson,well youre gonna win cause youve got star quality like the hulk in movies other than the hulk
Homer Simpson,what are you talkin about marge and i are goin great
Homer Simpson,it was during happy hour dont you want our baby to be happy
Homer Simpson,how can something that applies to bart apply to me im so much older and wiser
Homer Simpson,why you little ill teach you to say something that sounds similar
Bart Simpson,i dont know what she wants what would my heroes say
Bart Simpson,um lifting peoples spirits is an interesting topic for centuries neanderthal and astronaut alike have enjoyed lifting spirits
Bart Simpson,mary weve just been through three hours of music usually i only have music one hour a week and the teacher spends it reading real estate listings for fire island
Bart Simpson,good idea i can chuck eggs at the other couples
Bart Simpson,give me another chance ill be way more attentive to your needs on the seesaw -- ill stay down there for as long as you want
Marge Simpson,i was the only one without a date at pattys new lady friends travel bookstore soft opening
Homer Simpson,you told me it was up to me if i wanted to go
Marge Simpson,you should know that me saying i dont care means i couldnt care more
Homer Simpson,i am sick and tired of trying to decode you like youre some kind of human being separate from myself
Marge Simpson,bart would you go to your room while your father and i finish our little talk
Bart Simpson,little talk you guys are having a big fight this is the problem with women they dont say what they mean until its too late
Marge Simpson,all right fine if you boys want it ill tell you what i really think
Marge Simpson,youre both in the doghouse which is misleading cause i still like the dog
Bart Simpson,so this is where you go when mom kicks you out
Homer Simpson,youre saying it like it happens all the time and by the way the paints a little faded on my parking spot you call this a platinum club experience
Homer Simpson,standard hotel boilerplate it just says somebody died in this room in the last seventy-two hours
Bart Simpson,mary thats odd i thought i was calling the suicide not line because im doin great so um how are you handling taking a break
Homer Simpson,i had this idea years agobut your mother wouldnt let me do it
Homer Simpson,you know what we need a classic kicked outta the house party now whos got a rockin cd
Bart Simpson,spuckler mary please forgive me all i ask is one more chance
Homer Simpson,this calls for decisive action -- like lbjs use of the period of mourning following the assassination to push through the civil rights act
Homer Simpson,agreed but to win back our women we need to make a grand romantic gesture
Homer Simpson,and i promise to do the things i checked off within a year
Bart Simpson,but im the main guy in this story things are supposed to work out for me
Homer Simpson,finally a kids show that isnt trying to sell you something which reminds me we need to order more rectangles
Marge Simpson,i threw that away because studies show it doesnt do any good
Marge Simpson,maybe instead of watching tv with the kids you could take them outside and what are you doing
Marge Simpson,this so-called educational dvd may have even stunted the development of the kids who watched it
Marge Simpson,while bart turned out so wonderful in his own way
Bart Simpson,thats the way people talk about ralph ralph whose favorite color is peanut butter
Marge Simpson,and now that i know better no dvds for you kids just educational television
Homer Simpson,honey this sounds like a noble experiment but like prohibition it will end in a hail of bullets
Marge Simpson,we can do without tv for a day were taking maggie to a childrens bookstore where she can learn the old-fashioned way -- the way children did from nineteen-ten to two thousand and two
Homer Simpson,if i buy you why do i need all these books
Marge Simpson,instead of watching tv we can read childrens books written by tv stars
Homer Simpson,boy youre pretty pushy for a book i just met
Homer Simpson,gotcha candy cane in the umbrella stand -- oldest trick in the book okay lets see
Homer Simpson,if theyre not a trumpet or a rolling pin then no
Homer Simpson,okay now to see if i can apply my book knowledge to the real world
Bart Simpson,dont worry ill clean it up get me some whipped cream and a safety scissors
Bart Simpson,dont worry all i need is a cigarette lighter and some sandpaper
Bart Simpson,milhouse if people believe youre a grownup we could do anything
Bart Simpson,okay first tone it down time to teach you to be a man
Homer Simpson,sometimes its just so nice to have a man take charge
Bart Simpson,kirk remember you have the super-powers of a middle-aged man
Marge Simpson,i dont think so the us embassy has warned people not to go to downtown springfield
Bart Simpson,just one sec nelson gave me some notes on a prank im doing
Bart Simpson,now i asked you here because i know a cool grownup who will take you to that club in the city
Bart Simpson,the baby poindexter company is being forced to pay a settlement to any parent who had enough misguided love to buy their videos
Bart Simpson,well if i look at your face i get sick
Bart Simpson,thats all you pay for screwing up a child for life
Marge Simpson,homer bart said the kids were going to the van houtens but luann just told me theyre supposed to be here theyve disappeared
Marge Simpson,do you think lisa went to that jazz club i wouldnt take her to
Bart Simpson,lady my stomachs full and i wanna go thats how it works in this country
Marge Simpson,the top of your head has a five oclock shadow
Homer Simpson,why you little thats not a heartwarming thing to end on
Homer Simpson,i cant believe youre reading when theres so much great stuff on tv
Homer Simpson,writing is for bathroom walls and acting is for getting out of duis the only reason tv exists is for reality shows about white-trash scuzzbags doing sub-human made-up jobs
Homer Simpson,no one feels out a unit like cj not bubba not debbie and danny no one
Homer Simpson,were gonna get rich off the poor and forgetful and dead people
Homer Simpson,theres other pos uh-oh better put on my game shades
Marge Simpson,we spent a thousand dollars on a bunch of old boxes
Homer Simpson,you wont be laughing when these boxes are full of priceless treasures
Homer Simpson,tights robes this stupid locker must have belonged to some old lady
Marge Simpson,its not all lady stuff look at all these fitness publications
Homer Simpson,thats insane my dad was married to a woman who left him because he ignored her needs for decades my gay dad is gay for gays
Marge Simpson,i think this is great old gay men are adorable like wrinkle dogs in a wrinkle dog calendar
Marge Simpson,your dads been in the closet for so long he probably doesnt know how tolerant societys become they even had a gay float in the pride parade last year
Homer Simpson,my dads always been so angry maybe if we help him be who he is hell finally be happy
Bart Simpson,you sure youre not just doing all this because its cool to be accepting of a gay family member
Marge Simpson,oh honey thats just silly thisll show helen lovejoy always bragging about her he-she cousin
Homer Simpson,its okay dad we know the truth and we love you
Homer Simpson,just admit who you are and you can find new love
Marge Simpson,if you dont want to die alone come out of your room
Marge Simpson,your father wasted his whole life being married to your mother and having you weve got to find him a boyfriend before its too late
Bart Simpson,its weird that you dont consider yourself a young person
Marge Simpson,help me out of the closet wonderful older man seeks life partner before rapidly-encroaching death
Marge Simpson,okay post this under men seeking men but what sub-heading nothing too serious here we go -- casual encounters perfect no pressure
Homer Simpson,if i cant find my father a man to kiss and cuddle then ive failed as a son
Marge Simpson,dont you want to be happy abe admit who you are a wonderful gay man
Homer Simpson,you were a world-famous wrestler spill the beans old man word beans
Homer Simpson,i dont know should i really let the men who ruined my past and present hang out with the kid whos going to ruin my future
Bart Simpson,i cant wait to see grampa kick some ass hes always pretended to be boring but hes really a straight-up psycho
Marge Simpson,your grandfather is not psycho the only thing hes straight-up is loves you
Homer Simpson,apparently old folks homes are full of people that used to be things just like you and me swear to god
Bart Simpson,you show em godfrey youre the prettiest old man in the world
Marge Simpson,its so sad that grampa has to cheat instead of relying on his god-given wrestling skills what kind of person revels in disapproval
Bart Simpson,you are the luckiest people in the world you get to look at me
Marge Simpson,your behavior at that game was unacceptable youre lucky they gave you your participant trophy
Homer Simpson,heel oh no tell me you are not trying to be like grampa
Bart Simpson,well sure i am i always thought grampa was lame but hes really awesome
Homer Simpson,your grandfather is super lame i mean if he wasnt a terrible father whats my excuse for this
Marge Simpson,i know your grampa seems exciting now but all that preening and cheating those turnbuckle antics are not gonna make him happy
Homer Simpson,you grandson-ruining fiend look what your number one fan did at show and tell
Homer Simpson,how are you a winner youre cheating in a fake sport
Homer Simpson,bart cannot be an old-time wrestler as your inattentive son and your incompetent employee i forbid it
Bart Simpson,you know it glamorous eye gouge ear bite folding chair hair pull face-fart flying face-fart and then i start fighting dirty
Marge Simpson,i dont care if bart is a wrestler a busboy or even a stoplight squeegee man as long as hes a nice person
Marge Simpson,but if he gets too much attention for acting bad he might turn bad on the inside
Homer Simpson,hes taking on mean man monty go get him honest abe
Marge Simpson,i thought you might be cold honey so i put this chinchilla coat on you
Marge Simpson,its not chinchilla i just thought she needed more sleep

Homer Simpson,every time i try to fix things it just makes things worse but im gonna fix this
Homer Simpson,to elaborate i want your wife the teacher to help get rid of lisas substitute
Homer Simpson,how much plutonium do you want gotta warn you it might take me twenty minutes to get it

Homer Simpson,marge this is amazing i never realized some restaurants are better than others
Marge Simpson,so without the kids we can have sophisticated grownup talk
Marge Simpson,when god rested on the seventh day did he take a nap or do a hobby he enjoyed
Marge Simpson,can you chew with your mouth closed its like looking into a garbage disposal
Marge Simpson,the most romantic part of this was the hold music when i made the reservation

Homer Simpson,great practice guys what do you say we give it another six hours then call it a day
Homer Simpson,oh yeah apu im sure youre a great singer but the balance of the band is really delicate right now and were not really looking for a world music vibe no disrespect to world music i love world music
Homer Simpson,we are more than just a garage band desperate to do anything other than hang out with our families we are now a cover band and we shall be called covercraft because we play covers and this is our craft
Homer Simpson,okay this crowd is about to experience the special magic of the cover band -- the thrill of live music without the fear of hearing anything new
Homer Simpson,buddy buddy think of it this way youre not singing in front of all those people youre alone at the kwik-e-mart in the middle of the night you just wear this on stage and everything will be fine
Bart Simpson,everyone loves you dad you could become a famous rock star
Homer Simpson,well son i do have the talent -- my mind is full of ideas for great songs i could write down the names of and then cover but then i remember im just a regular guy jamming with my buds
Marge Simpson,oh sweetie this band has brought out the best in you
Homer Simpson,yep its all about the music and it would take a pretty unforeseen development to change that pretty unforeseen
Homer Simpson,guys i really need your honesty here at the squidport senior jamboree was i too in the pocket
Homer Simpson,i think i can answer for apu hes flattered but the small-time success of covercraft is all that any of us have ever wanted

Marge Simpson,stop feeling sorry for yourself your friend had a wonderful thing happen to him and you are coming with us to share in his talent

Marge Simpson,i wonder why bart and lisa are so late getting home from school
Homer Simpson,hey how come you can watch cartoons but the kids cant
Marge Simpson,im cataloguing the violence in these cartoons i dont think adults have ever actually sat down and watched them before
Marge Simpson,what kind of warped human being would find that funny
Marge Simpson,this is the kind of entertainment they think is suitable for younger and more impressionable viewers
Marge Simpson,ill tell you what im going to do im going to write a letter
Marge Simpson,dear purveyors of senseless violence i know this may sound silly at first
Marge Simpson,but i believe that the cartoons you show to our children are influencing their behavior in a negative way
Homer Simpson,oh well how long are we going to have to be doing this
Marge Simpson,well ive never changed the world before so i dont know how long it takes exactly but if enough people take an interest
Marge Simpson,but there are many others whose minds are being warped every afternoon at four
Bart Simpson,that reminds me ive gotta get over to milhouses and uh play sports
Marge Simpson,and what happens when a child grows up with insanely violent role models like these
Marge Simpson,how many of you were hit on the head with mallets last week
Homer Simpson,i didnt know they still made tv dinners this bad
Bart Simpson,oop i guess ill just go and watch some cartoons
Marge Simpson,no im sorry about the dinners ill make up for it tomorrow night

Marge Simpson,oh please all right im trying to earn a living here all right stop stop
Homer Simpson,you know some of these stories are pretty good i never know mice lived such interesting lives
Marge Simpson,so much needless brutality i dont know if im having any impact at all
Marge Simpson,what is it what smartline yes ive heard of your late-night panel discussion show well id love to
Bart Simpson,me and the guys went fishing almost caught a catfish this big
Marge Simpson,excuse me there is i think that its a bad influence on children
Marge Simpson,yes id like to ask all the parents in springfield who are concerned about this to write in and let the cartoon makers know how you feel thank you
Marge Simpson,well lets see oh couldnt itchy share his pie with scratchy then they would both have pie
Marge Simpson,i think it conveys a very nice message of sharing
Marge Simpson,arent you going to watch the rest of your cute cartoons
Homer Simpson,wow what great kids this is the golden age marge and the parents of springfield owe it all to you
Homer Simpson,well i always knew youd change the world for the better
Marge Simpson,im not i think everyone in springfield should see it
Marge Simpson,well i guess i cant which is a shame because i really hate those cartoons
Marge Simpson,um i dont know i guess one person can make a difference but most of the time they probably shouldnt
Marge Simpson,oh homie here the kids have a chance to see a great work of art and instead theyre home watching a cat and mouse disembowel each other
Homer Simpson,hey dont worry marge pretty soon every boy and girl in springfield elementary school is gonna come and see this thing
Bart Simpson,um say is there anything i can do to avoid coming back here
Marge Simpson,oh bart we thought for a minute youd gone away from us
Bart Simpson,i did go away mom i was miles and miles and miles away writhing in agony in the pits of hell and you were there and you and you and you you ive never seen before
Homer Simpson,hey yeah who are you i saw you chasing barts ambulance
Homer Simpson,well the fiend who did this to my boy is my boss and besides the doctor says its just a bump on the head and a broken toe nothing serious
Marge Simpson,mr hutz this is hardly the time or place to discuss this
Marge Simpson,is he well enough for me to start mothering him unbearably doctor
Homer Simpson,yeah if i wasnt so spineless id march into mr burns office right now and
Homer Simpson,w-well its a v-very generous offer sir but his medical bills alone
Homer Simpson,you dont have to do that mr burns i can throw myself out
Homer Simpson,well i dunno you and i might have different ideas about just how big a big cash settlement is
Homer Simpson,whoo ooo i stand corrected a million bucks is a-okay
Homer Simpson,no of course youre not going to die everythings fine
Marge Simpson,thats right he did excuse me but dr hibbert has been our family physician for years and he thought bart was fine
Marge Simpson,well maybe lisa does have a point i dont mind you boys doing this in the living room but in court doesnt bart have to tell the truth
Bart Simpson,yes sir it was a beautiful sunday afternoon i was playing in my wholesome childlike way little realizing that i was about to be struck down by the luxury car of death
Bart Simpson,luckily i was not killed that day although sometimes i wish i had been
Marge Simpson,i dont know maybe we should take his money and put all this ugliness behind us
Homer Simpson,ill tell you what i think i think he thinks im an idiot the only reason hes offering us this is because he knows hes gonna lose the trial and have to pay us a cool million
Homer Simpson,five hundred thousand dollars i spit on his five hundred thousand dollars
Marge Simpson,homer whats happened to you all this greediness and lying and shifty lawyers and phony doctors --
Marge Simpson,do you know what id settle for if it was up to me barts medical bills and an apology
Marge Simpson,yes hes been our family physician and trusted friend ever since the day i became a mother hes seen us through everything from colds to impetigo with competence and loving care
Marge Simpson,im sorry but my mother always said if you cant say anything nice dont say anything at all
Marge Simpson,well to be honest he seemed a lot more concerned about wrapping bart in bandages than in making him feel better and he mispronounced words that even i know like abdomen and his office was dirty now that i think about it im not sure hes even a doctor
Marge Simpson,but well i guess he did miss three days of school --
Marge Simpson,it was a little hard on me having him around the house
Marge Simpson,well we pay bart five dollars a week to take out the trash
Marge Simpson,i suppose if hed been able to do it that week we might have given him the five dollars
Homer Simpson,a million dollars my wife cost me a million dollars
Homer Simpson,yeah a million dollars worth you treacherous snake woman no thank you
Homer Simpson,no i dont want any string beans either you two-timing back-stabbing uh oh i better answer no thank you
