committee reports even part bill arrives desk You didnt vote law I didnt sign law Yet theyre treated force law The time come end practice So let us work together reform budget process expose every

Americas children I ask Congress reauthorize law A future hope opportunity requires citizens affordable available health care When comes health care government obligation care elderly disabled poor children And meet responsibilities For Americans private health insurance best way meet needs But many Americans cannot afford health insurance policy And tonight I propose two new initiatives help Americans afford insurance First I propose standard tax deduction health insurance standard tax deduction dependents Families health insurance pay income payroll tax payroll taxes 15000 income Single Americans health insurance pay income payroll taxes 7500 income With reform 100 million men women children covered employerprovided insurance benefit lower tax bills At time reform level playing field get health insurance job For Americans purchase health insurance proposal would mean substantial tax savings 4500 family four making 60000 year And millions Americans health insurance deduction would help put basic private health insurance plan within reach Changing tax code vital necessary step making health care affordable Americans My second proposal help states coming innovative ways cover uninsured States make basic private health insurance available citizens receive federal funds help provide coverage poor sick I asked Secretary Health Human Services work Congress take existing federal funds use create Affordable Choices grants These grants would give nations governors money flexibility get private health insurance need There many ways Congress help We need expand Health Savings Accounts We need help small businesses Association Health Plans We need reduce costs medical errors better information technology We encourage price transparency And protect doctors junk lawsuits passing medical liability reform In must remember best health care decisions made government insurance companies patients doctors Extending hope opportunity country requires immigration system worthy America laws fair borders secure When laws borders routinely violated harms interests country To secure border doubling size Border Patrol funding new infrastructure technology Yet even steps cannot fully secure border unless take pressure border requires temporary worker program We establish legal orderly path foreign workers enter country work temporary basis As result wont try

previous 4 years Auto sales way Home sales record high Millions Americans refinanced homes economy produced 16 million private sector jobs 1993 created previous 4 years combined The people supported economic plan proud early results Proud But everyone Chamber know acknowledge Next month I send one toughest budgets ever presented Congress It cut spending 300 programs eliminate 100 domestic programs reform ways governments buy goods services This year must make hard choices live within hard spending ceilings set We must We proved bring deficit without choking recovery without punishing

system The old unemployment system sort kept going waited old job come back Weve got new system move people new better jobs old jobs come back And know way real job security future get job growing income real skills ability learn new ones So weve got streamline todays patchwork training programs make source new skills people lose jobs Reemployment unemployment must become centerpiece economic renewal I urge pass session Congress And must transform unemployment system must also revolutionize welfare system It doesnt work It defies values Nation If value work cant justify system makes welfare attractive work people worried losing health care If value responsibility cant ignore 34 billion child support absent parents ought paying millions parents taking care children If value strong families cant perpetuate system actually penalizes stay together Can believe child child gets money Government leaving home staying home parent grandparent Thats bad policy wrong And ought change I worked problem years I became President Governors Members Congress parties previous administration another party I worked people welfare lots And I want say something everybody cares issue The people want change system people dependent They want get welfare They want go back work They want right kids I hearing I Governor I brought people welfare America found way work The woman State testified asked question Whats best thing welfare job And without blinking eye looked 40 Governors said When boy goes school say mother living give answer These people want better system ought give Last year began We gave States power innovate know lot great ideas come outside Washington many States already using Then Congress took dramatic step Instead taxing people modest incomes poverty helped work way poverty dramatically increasing earnedincome tax credit It lift 15 million working families poverty rewarding work welfare making possible people successful workers successful parents Now thats real welfare reform But done This spring I send comprehensive welfare reform bill builds Family Support Act 1988 restores basic values work responsibility Well say teenagers If child wedlock longer give check set separate household We want families stay together say absent parents arent paying child support If providing children well garnish wages suspend license track across State lines necessary make work owe People bring children world cannot must walk away But depend welfare offer ultimately simple compact Well provide support job training child care need 2 years But anyone work must private sector wherever possible community service necessary Thats way well ever make welfare ought second chance way life I know difficult tackle welfare reform 1994 time tackle health care But let point I think inevitable imperative It estimated one million people welfare way get health care coverage children Those choose leave welfare jobs without health benefits many entrylevel jobs health benefits find incredible position paying taxes help pay health care coverage made choice stay welfare No wonder people leave work go back welfare get health care coverage Weve got solve health care problem real welfare reform So year make history reforming health care system And I would say fellow public servants another issue people way ahead politicians That may popular either party happens truth You know First Lady received almost million letters people across America walks life Id share one Richard Anderson Reno Nevada lost job health insurance Two weeks later wife Judy suffered cerebral aneurysm He rushed hospital stayed intensive care 21 days The Andersons bills 120000 Although Judy recovered Richard went back work 8 hour bills much literally forced bankruptcy Mrs Clinton wrote Hillary one United States America lose everything theyve worked lives unfortunate enough become ill It help Richard Judy Andersons America First Lady many others worked hard long health care reform issue We owe thanks action I know people say theres health care crisis Tell Richard Judy Anderson Tell 58 million Americans coverage time year Tell 81 million Americans preexisting conditions Those folks paying cant get insurance Or cant ever change jobs someone family one preexisting conditions Tell small businesses burdened skyrocketing cost insurance Most small businesses cover employees pay average 35 percent premiums big businesses Government Or tell 76 percent insured Americans three four whose policies lifetime limits And means find without coverage need So believe theres crisis tell people I cant There people literally understand impact problem peoples lives And go listen Just go talk anywhere congressional district country Theyre Republicans Democrats independents doesnt lick party They think get And time show get From day began health care initiative designed strengthen health care system worlds best health care professionals cuttingedge research wonderful research institutions Medicare older Americans None none put risk But paying money less less care Every year fewer fewer Americans even get choose doctors Every year doctors nurses spend

call shots They pick cover cover They cut benefits need coverage They charge What mean It means every night millions wellinsured Americans go bed illness accident pink slip away coverage financial ruin It means every morning millions Americans go work without health insurance something workers advanced country world It means every year hardworking people told pick new doctor boss pick new plan And countless others turn better jobs know take better job lose health insurance If let health care system continue drift country people less care fewer choices higher bills Now approach protects quality care peoples choices It builds works private sector expand employerbased coverage guarantee private insurance every American And I might say employerbased private insurance every American proposed 20 years ago President Richard Nixon United States Congress It idea better idea Why want guaranteed private insurance Because right 9 10 people insurance get employers And continue And employer providing benefits reasonable prices continue That ought make Congress President feel better Our goal health insurance everybody depend comprehensive benefits cover preventive care prescription drugs health premiums explode get sick get older power matter small business choose dependable insurance competitive rates governments big business get one simple form people sick freedom choose plan right choose doctor Our approach protects older Americans Every plan Congress proposes slow growth Medicare The difference We believe savings used improve health care senior citizens

something People smoke pay pack cigarettes Everybody contribute something want solve health care crisis There cant something nothing It easy done Now coming months I hope much work Democrats Republicans reform health care system using market bring costs achieve lasting health security But look history see 60 years country tried reform health care President Roosevelt tried President Truman tried President Nixon tried President Carter tried Every time special interests powerful enough defeat But time I know facing interests require courage It raise critical questions way finance

empower people way move Government directly workers America Now one us call tax cut I wont accept one explodes deficit puts recovery risk We ought pay tax cuts fully honestly Just 2 years ago open question whether would find strength cut deficit Thanks courage people many didnt return cut deficit We began others said would done We cut deficit 600 billion 10000 every family country Its coming 3 years row first time since Mr Truman President I think anybody America wants us let explode In budget I send middle class bill rights fully paid budget cuts bureaucracy cuts programs cuts special interest subsidies And spending cuts double tax cuts My budget pays middle class bill rights without cuts Medicare And I oppose attempts pay tax cuts Medicare cuts Thats right thing I know lot ideas tax relief I find quite interesting I really want work My test proposals Will create jobs raise incomes strengthen families support children paid build middle class shrink underclass If Ill support But doesnt I wont The goal building middle class shrinking underclass also I believe raise minimum wage It rewards work Two half million Americans two half million Americans often women children working 425 hour In terms real buying power next year minimum wage 40year low Thats idea new economy ought work Now Ive studied arguments evidence minimum wage increase I believe weight evidence modest increase cost jobs may even lure people back job market But important thing cant make living 425 hour especially children even working families tax cut passed last year In past minimum wage bipartisan issue I think So I want challenge honest hearings get together find way make minimum wage living wage Members Congress less month end week 28 days new year every Member Congress earned much congressional salary minimum wage worker makes year long Everybody else including President something else many Americans without thats health care Now last year almost came blows health care didnt anything And cold hard fact since last year since I another 11 million Americans working families lost health care And cold hard fact many millions farmers small business people selfemployed people seen premiums skyrocket copays deductibles go Theres whole bunch people country statistics health insurance really theyve got piece paper says wont lose home get sick Now I still believe country got move toward providing health security every American family But I know last year evidence indicates bit could chew So Im asking work together Lets step step Lets whatever get something done Lets least pass meaningful insurance reform American risks losing coverage facing skyrocketing prices nobody loses coverage face high prices unavailable insurance change jobs lose job family member gets sick I want work together interest Democrats worked last time Republican leaders Senator Dole longtime commitment health care reform made constructive proposals area last year We ought make sure selfemployed people small businesses buy insurance affordable rates voluntary purchasing pools We ought help families provide longterm care sick parent disabled child We work help workers lose jobs least keep

productive economy first time nearly decade But cant proud fact wealthy country world smaller percentage work force children health insurance 10 years ago last time productive economy world So lets work together It important politics usual Much American people thinking tonight weve already talked A lot people think security concerns America entirely internal borders They relate security jobs

nest egg Thats working lift value familys single largest investment home The steps took last year shore housing market allowed millions Americans take new loans save average 1500 mortgage payments This year step refinancing homeowners move affordable mortgages And precisely relieve burden middleclass families still need health insurance reform Yes Now lets clear things I didnt choose tackle issue get legislative victory belt And fairly obvious I didnt take health care politics I took health care stories Ive heard Americans preexisting conditions whose lives depend getting coverage patients whove denied coverage families even insurance one illness away financial ruin After nearly century trying Democratic administrations Republican administrations closer ever bringing security lives many Americans The approach weve taken would protect every American worst practices insurance industry It would give small businesses uninsured Americans chance choose affordable health care plan competitive market It would require every insurance plan cover preventive care And way I want acknowledge First Lady Michelle Obama year creating national movement tackle epidemic childhood obesity make kids healthier Thank She gets embarrassed Our approach would preserve right Americans insurance keep doctor plan It would reduce costs premiums millions families businesses And according Congressional Budget Office independent organization parties cited official scorekeeper Congress approach would bring deficit much 1 trillion next two decades Still complex issue longer debated skeptical people became I take share blame explaining clearly American people And I know lobbying horsetrading process left Americans wondering Whats But I also know problem going away By time Im finished speaking tonight Americans lost health insurance Millions lose year Our deficit grow Premiums go Patients denied care need Small business owners continue drop coverage altogether I walk away Americans neither people chamber So temperatures cool I want everyone take another look plan weve proposed Theres reason many doctors nurses health care experts know system best consider approach vast improvement status quo But anyone either party better approach bring premiums bring deficit cover uninsured strengthen Medicare seniors stop insurance company abuses let know Let know Let know Im eager see Heres I ask Congress though Dont walk away reform Not Not close Let us find way come together finish job American people Lets get done Lets get done Now even health care reform would reduce deficit enough dig us massive fiscal hole find Its challenge makes others much harder solve one thats subject lot political posturing So let start discussion government spending setting record straight At beginning last decade year 2000 America budget surplus 200 billion By time I took office oneyear deficit 1 trillion projected deficits 8 trillion next decade Most result paying two wars two tax cuts expensive prescription drug program On top effects recession put 3 trillion hole budget All I walked door Now stating facts Now taken office ordinary times I would liked nothing start bringing deficit But took office amid crisis And efforts prevent second depression added another 1 trillion national debt That fact Im absolutely convinced right thing But families across country tightening belts making tough decisions The federal government So tonight Im proposing specific steps pay trillion dollars took rescue economy last year Starting 2011 prepared freeze government spending three years Spending related national security Medicare Medicaid Social Security affected But discretionary government programs Like cashstrapped family work within budget invest need sacrifice And I enforce discipline veto I We continue go budget line line page page eliminate programs cant afford work Weve already identified 20 billion savings next year To help working families well extend middleclass tax cuts But time record deficits continue tax cuts oil companies investment fund managers making 250000 year We cant afford Now even paying spent watch well still face massive deficit I took office More importantly cost Medicare Medicaid Social Security continue skyrocket Thats Ive called bipartisan fiscal commission modeled proposal Republican Judd Gregg Democrat Kent Conrad This cant one Washington gimmicks lets us pretend solved problem The commission provide specific set solutions certain deadline Now yesterday Senate blocked bill would created commission So Ill issue executive order allow us go forward I refuse pass problem another generation Americans And vote comes tomorrow Senate restore payasyougo law big reason record surpluses 1990s Now I know party argue cant address deficit freeze government spending many still hurting And I agree freeze wont take effect next year economy stronger Thats budgeting works But understand understand take meaningful steps rein debt could damage markets increase cost borrowing jeopardize recovery would even worse effect job growth family incomes From right I expect well hear different argument make fewer investments people extend tax cuts including wealthier Americans eliminate regulations maintain status quo health care deficits go away The problem thats eight years Thats helped us crisis Its helped lead deficits We cant Rather fight tired battles dominated Washington decades time try something new Lets invest people without leaving mountain debt Lets meet responsibility citizens sent us Lets try common sense A novel concept To recognize face deficit dollars right We face deficit trust deep corrosive doubts Washington works growing years To close credibility gap take action ends Pennsylvania Avenue end outsized influence lobbyists work openly give people government deserve Thats I came Washington Thats first time history administration posts White House visitors online Thats weve excluded lobbyists policymaking jobs seats federal boards commissions But cant stop Its time require lobbyists disclose contact make behalf client administration Congress Its time put strict limits contributions lobbyists give candidates federal office With due deference separation powers last week Supreme Court reversed century law I believe open floodgates special interests including foreign corporations spend without limit elections I think American elections bankrolled Americas powerful interests worse foreign entities They decided American people And Id urge Democrats Republicans pass bill helps correct problems Im also calling Congress continue path earmark reform Democrats Republicans Democrats Republicans Youve trimmed spending youve embraced meaningful change But restoring public trust demands For example members Congress post earmark requests online Tonight Im calling Congress publish earmark requests single Web site theres vote American people see money spent Of course none reforms even happen also reform work one another Now Im I never thought mere fact election would usher peace harmony postpartisan era I knew parties fed divisions deeply entrenched And issues simply philosophical differences always cause us part ways These disagreements role government lives national priorities national security theyve taking place 200 years Theyre essence democracy But frustrates American people Washington every day Election Day We cant wage perpetual campaign goal see get embarrassing headlines side belief lose I win Neither party delay obstruct every single bill The confirmation Im speaking parties The confirmation wellqualified public servants shouldnt held hostage pet projects grudges individual senators Washington may think saying anything side matter false matter malicious part game But precisely politics stopped either party helping American people Worse yet sowing division among citizens distrust government So I give trying change tone politics I know election year And last week clear campaign fever come even earlier usual But still need govern To Democrats I would remind still largest majority decades people expect us solve problems run hills And Republican leadership going insist 60 votes Senate required business town supermajority responsibility govern well Just saying everything may shortterm politics leadership We sent serve citizens ambitions So lets show American people together This week Ill addressing meeting House Republicans Id begin monthly meetings Democratic Republican leadership I know cant wait Throughout

system Get rid loopholes Level playing field And use savings lower corporate tax rate first time 25 years without adding deficit To help businesses sell products abroad set goal doubling exports 2014 export jobs create home Already exports Recently signed agreements India China support 250000 jobs United States And last month finalized trade agreement South Korea support least 70000 American jobs This agreement unprecedented support business labor Democrats Republicans I ask Congress pass soon possible Before I took office I made clear would enforce trade agreements I would sign deals keep faith American workers promote American jobs Thats Korea thats I intend pursue agreements Panama Colombia continue Asia Pacific global trade talks To reduce barriers growth investment Ive ordered review government regulations When find rules put unnecessary burden businesses fix But I hesitate create enforce commonsense safeguards protect American people Thats weve done country century Its food safe eat water safe drink air safe breathe Its speed limits child labor laws Its last year put place consumer protections hidden fees penalties credit card companies new rules prevent another

president This freeze require painful cuts Already frozen salaries hardworking federal employees next two years Ive proposed cuts things I care deeply community action programs The Secretary Defense also agreed cut tens billions dollars spending generals believe military without I recognize Chamber already proposed deeper cuts Im willing eliminate whatever honestly afford without But lets make sure backs vulnerable citizens And lets make sure cutting really excess weight Cutting deficit gutting investments innovation education lightening overloaded airplane removing engine It may feel flying high first wont take long youll feel impact Now cuts savings Ive proposed address annual domestic spending represents little 12 budget To make progress stop pretending cutting kind spending alone enough It wont The bipartisan Fiscal Commission I created last year made crystal clear I agree proposals made important progress And conclusion way tackle deficit cut excessive spending wherever find domestic spending defense spending health care spending spending tax breaks loopholes This means reducing health care costs including programs Medicare Medicaid single biggest contributor longterm deficit Health insurance reform slow rising costs part nonpartisan economists said repealing health care law would add quarter trillion dollars deficit Still Im willing look ideas bring costs including one Republicans suggested last year medical malpractice reform rein frivolous lawsuits To put us solid ground also find bipartisan solution strengthen Social Security future generations And must without putting risk current retirees vulnerable people disabilities without slashing benefits future generations without subjecting Americans guaranteed retirement income whims stock market And truly care deficit simply cannot afford permanent extension tax cuts wealthiest 2 Americans Before take money away schools scholarships away students ask millionaires give tax break Its matter

future We live time extraordinary change change thats reshaping way live way work planet place world Its change promises amazing medical breakthroughs also economic disruptions strain working families It promises education girls remote villages also connects terrorists plotting ocean away Its change broaden opportunity widen inequality And whether pace change accelerate America big changes wars depression influx new immigrants workers fighting fair deal movements expand civil rights Each time told us fear future claimed could slam brakes change promised restore past glory got group idea threatening America control And time overcame fears We words Lincoln adhere dogmas quiet past Instead thought anew acted anew We made change work us always extending Americas promise outward next frontier people And saw opportunity awhere others saw peril emerged stronger better What true true Our unique strengths nationour optimism work ethic spirit discovery diversity commitment rule lawthese things give us everything need ensure prosperity security generations come In fact spirit made progress past 7 years Thats recovered worst economic crisis generations Thats reformed health care system reinvented energy sector Thats delivered care benefits troops coming home veterans Thats secured freedom every State marry person love But progress inevitable Its result choices make together And face choices right Will respond changes time fear turning inward nation turning people Or face future confidence stand incredible things together So lets talk future four big questions I believe country answer regardless next President controls next Congress First give everyone fair shot opportunity security new economy Second make technology work us us especially comes solving urgent challenges climate change Third keep America safe lead world without becoming policeman And finally make politics reflect whats best us whats worst Let start economy basic fact The United States America right strongest durable economy world Were middle longest streak private sector job creation history More 14 million new jobs strongest 2 years job growth since 1990s unemployment rate cut half Our auto industry best year ever Thats part manufacturing surge thats created nearly 900000 new jobs past 6 years And weve done cutting deficits almost threequarters Anyone claiming Americas economy decline peddling fiction Now trueand reason lot Americans feel anxiousis economy changing profound ways changes started long great recession hit changes let Today technology doesnt replace jobs assembly line job work automated Companies global economy locate anywhere face tougher competition As result workers less leverage raise Companies less loyalty communities And wealth income concentrated top All trends squeezed workers even jobs even economy growing Its made harder hardworking family pull poverty harder young people start careers tougher workers retire want And although none trends unique America offend uniquely American belief everybody works hard get fair shot For past 7 years goal growing economy also works better everybody Weve made progress need make And despite political arguments weve past years actually areas Americans broadly agree We agree real opportunity requires every American get education training need land goodpaying job The bipartisan reform No Child Left Behind important start together weve increased early childhood education lifted high school graduation rates new highs boosted graduates fields engineering In coming years build progress providing preK offering every student handson computer science math classes make jobready day one We recruit support great teachers kids And make college affordable every American No hardworking student stuck red Weve already reduced student loan payments byto 10 percent borrowers income And thats But weve actually got cut cost college Providing 2 years community college cost every responsible student one best ways Im going keep fighting get started year Its right thing But great education isnt need new economy We also need benefits protections provide basic measure security Its much stretch say people America going work job place health retirement package 30 years sitting Chamber Laughter For everyone else especially folks forties fifties saving retirement bouncing back job loss gotten lot tougher Americans understand point careers new economy may retool may retrain But shouldnt lose theyve already worked hard build process Thats Social Security Medicare important ever We shouldnt weaken strengthen And Americans short retirement basic benefits mobile everything else That way Affordable Care Act Its filling gaps employerbased care lose job go back school strike launch new business youll still coverage Nearly 18 million people gained coverage far And process health care inflation slowed And businesses created jobs every single month since became law Now Im guessing wont agree health care anytime soon butlaughtera little applause back Laughter Just guess But ways parties work together improve economic security Say hardworking American loses job We shouldnt make sure get unemployment insurance make sure program encourages retrain business thats ready hire If new job doesnt pay much system wage insurance place still pay bills And even hes going job job still able save retirement take savings Thats way make new economy work better everybody I also know Speaker Ryan talked interest tackling poverty America giving everybody willing work chance hand And Id welcome serious discussion strategies support expanding tax cuts lowincome workers children But areas wherewe honestit difficult find agreement last 7 years And lot fall category role Government play making sure systems rigged favor wealthiest biggest corporations And honest disagreement American people choice make I believe thriving private sector lifeblood economy I think outdated regulations need changed There redtape needs cut Applause There go Yes See But years record corporate profits working families wont get opportunity bigger paychecks letting big banks big oil hedge funds make rules everybody elses expense Middle class families going feel secure allowed attacks collective bargaining go unanswered Food stamp recipients cause financial crisis recklessness Wall Street Immigrants arent principal reason wages havent gone decisions made boardrooms often put quarterly earnings longterm returns Its sure average family watching tonight avoids paying taxes offshore accounts Laughter The point I believe new economy workers startups small businesses need voice less The rules work And Im alone This year I plan lift many businesses figured right workers customers communities ends shareholders And I want spread best practices across America Thats part brighter future In fact turns many best corporate citizens also creative And brings second big question country answer How reignite spirit innovation meet biggest challenges Sixty years ago Russians beat us space didnt deny Sputnik Laughter We didnt argue science shrink research development budget We built space program almost overnight And 12 years later walking Moon Now spirit discovery DNA America Thomas Edison Wright Brothers George Washington Carver America Grace Hopper Katherine Johnson Sally Ride America every immigrant entrepreneur Boston Austin Silicon Valley racing shape better future Thats And past 7 years weve nurtured spirit Weve protected open Internet taken bold new steps get students lowincome Americans online Weve launched nextgeneration manufacturing hubs online tools give entrepreneur everything needs start business single day But much Last year Vice President Biden said new moonshot America cure cancer Last month worked Congress give scientists National Institutes Health strongest resources theyve decade Wellso tonight Im announcing new national effort get done And hes gone mat us many issues past 40 years Im putting Joe charge mission control For loved ones weve lost families still save lets make America country cures cancer What say Joe Lets make happen Now medical research critical We need level commitment comes developing clean energy sources Look anybody still wants dispute science around climate change Laughter You pretty lonely youll debating military Americas business leaders majority American people almost entire scientific community 200 nations around world agree problem intend solve But even planet wasnt stake even 2014 wasnt warmest year recorduntil 2015 turned even hotterwhy would want pass chance American businesses produce sell energy future Listen 7 years ago made single biggest investment clean energy history Here results In fields Iowa Texas wind power cheaper dirtier conventional power On rooftops Arizona New York solar saving Americans tens millions dollars year energy bills employs Americans coal jobs pay better average Were taking steps give homeowners freedom generate store energy something way environmentalists Tea Partiers teamed support And meanwhile weve cut imports foreign oil nearly 60 percent cut carbon pollution country Earth Gas 2 bucks gallon aint bad either Laughter Now weve got accelerate transition away old dirtier energy sources Rather subsidize past invest future especially communities rely fossil fuels We favor show trends going And thats Im going push change way manage oil coal resources better reflect costs impose taxpayers planet And way put money back communities put tens thousands Americans work building 21stcentury transportation system Now none going happen overnight And yes plenty entrenched interests want protect status quo But jobs well create money well save planet well preservethat kind future kids grandkids deserve And within grasp Now climate change one many issues security linked rest world And thats third big question answer together keep America safe strong without either isolating trying nationbuild everywhere theres problem Now I told earlier talk Americas economic decline political hot air Well rhetoric hear enemies getting stronger America getting weaker Let tell something The United States America powerful nation Earth Period Applause Period Its even close Applause Its even close Its even close We spend military next eight nations combined Our troops finest fighting force history world Applause All right No nation attacks us directly allies know thats path ruin Surveys show standing around world higher I elected office comes every important international issue people world look Beijing Moscow lead They call us So I think useful level set make decisions Now someone begins every day intelligence briefing I know dangerous time But thats primarily looming superpower certainly diminished American strength In todays world threatened less evil empires failing states The Middle East going transformation play generation rooted conflicts date back millennia Economic headwinds blowing Chinese economy significant transition Even economy severely contracts Russia pouring resources prop Ukraine Syria client states saw slipping away orbit And international system built World War II struggling keep pace new reality Its us United States America help remake system And well means weve got set priorities Priority number one protecting American people going terrorist networks Both Al Qaida ISIL pose direct threat people todays world even handful terrorists place value human life including lot damage They use Internet poison minds individuals inside country Their actions undermine destabilize allies We take But focus destroying ISIL overthetop claims world war III play hands Masses fighters back pickup trucks twisted souls plotting apartments garages pose enormous danger civilians stopped But threaten national existence That story ISIL wants tell Thats kind propaganda use recruit We need build show serious sure need push away vital allies fight echoing lie ISIL somehow representative one worlds largest religions We need call killers fanatics rooted hunted destroyed And thats exactly For year America led coalition 60 countries cut ISILs financing disrupt plots stop flow terrorist fighters stamp vicious ideology With nearly 10000 airstrikes taking leadership oil training camps weapons Were training arming supporting forces steadily reclaiming territory Iraq Syria If Congress serious winning war wants send message troops world authorize use military force ISIL Take vote Applause Take vote But American people know without congressional action ISIL learn lessons terrorists If doubt Americas commitmentor mineto see justice done ask Usama bin Laden Ask leader Al Qaida Yemen taken last year perpetrator Benghazi attacks sits prison cell When come Americans go And may take time long memories reach limits Our foreign policy focused threat ISIL Al Qaida cant stop For even without ISIL even without Al Qaida instability continue decades many parts world Middle East Afghanistan parts Pakistan parts Central America Africa Asia Some places may become safe havens new terrorist networks Others fall victim ethnic conflict famine feeding next wave refugees The world look us help solve problems answer needs tough talk calls carpetbomb civilians That may work TV sound bite doesnt pass muster world stage We also cant try take rebuild every country falls crisis even done best intentions Thats leadership thats recipe quagmire spilling American blood treasure ultimately weaken us Its lesson Vietnam lesson Iraq And learned Now fortunately smarter approach patient disciplined strategy uses every element national power It says America always act alone necessary protect people allies issues global concern mobilize world work us make sure countries pull weight Thats approach conflicts Syria partnering local forces leading international efforts help broken society pursue lasting peace Thats built global coalition sanctions principled diplomacy prevent nucleararmed Iran And speak Iran rolled back nuclear program shipped uranium stockpile world avoided another war Thats stopped spread Ebola West Africa Our military doctors development workersthey heroic set platform allowed countries join behind us stamp epidemic Hundreds thousands maybe couple million lives saved Thats forged TransPacific Partnership open markets protect workers environment advance American leadership Asia It cuts 18000 taxes products made America support jobs America With TPP China set rules region You want show strength new century Approve agreement Give us tools enforce Its right thing Let give another example Fifty years isolating Cuba failed promote democracy It set us back Latin America Thats restored diplomatic relations opened door travel commerce positioned improve lives Cuban people So want consolidate leadership credibility hemisphere recognize cold war Lift embargo The point American leadership 21st century choice ignoring rest worldexcept kill terroristsor occupying rebuilding whatever society unraveling Leadership means wise application military power rallying world behind causes right It means seeing foreign assistance part national security something separate charity When lead nearly 200 nations ambitious agreement history fight climate change yes helps vulnerable countries also protects kids When help Ukraine defend democracy Colombia resolve decadeslong war strengthens international order depend When help

respects us arsenal respects us diversity openness way respect every faith His Holiness Pope Francis told body spot Im standing tonight imitate hatred violence tyrants murderers best way take place When politicians insult Muslims whether abroad fellow citizens mosque vandalized kid called names doesnt make us safer Thats telling whattelling Its wrong It diminishes us eyes world It makes harder achieve goals It betrays country We People Our Constitution begins three simple words words weve come recognize mean people words insist rise fall together thats might perfect Union And brings fourth maybe important thing I want say tonight The future wantall us wantopportunity security families rising standard living sustainable peaceful planet kidsall within reach But happen work together It happen rational constructive debates It happen fix politics A better politics doesnt mean agree everything This big country different regions different attitudes different interests Thats one strengths Our Founders distributed power States branches government expected us argue fiercely size shape government commerce foreign relations meaning liberty imperatives security But democracy require basic bonds trust citizens It doesnt work think people disagree us motivated malice It doesnt work think political opponents unpatriotic trying weaken America Democracy grinds halt without willingness compromise even basic facts contested listen agree us Our public life withers extreme voices get attention And democracy breaks average person feels voice doesnt matter system rigged favor rich powerful special interest Too many Americans feel way right Its one regrets Presidency rancor suspicion parties gotten worse instead better I doubt President gifts Lincoln Roosevelt might better

voting rights generations Americans fought even died secure And frustration grows voices urging us fall back respective tribes scapegoat fellow citizens look us pray us vote share background We cant
